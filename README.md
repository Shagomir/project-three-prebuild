# Travel Log Application

## Description

This is a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application designed to allow users to create a list of places they would like to go when traveling. Users can create trips, create lists of waypoints, and then add comments to the lists as well as the individual waypoints. Users will log in to access their lists.  User authentication is implemented with JWT.
