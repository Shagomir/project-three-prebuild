# App Purpose

This app is designed to allow users to create a list of places they would like to go when traveling to a new place. They will be able to create trips, create lists of waypoints, and then add comments to the lists as well as the individual waypoints. Users will log in to access their lists. 

Other potential additions: 

Adding locations via geolocation.
Adding integrations with Google Maps.
Adding routing features.
